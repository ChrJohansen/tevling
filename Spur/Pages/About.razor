<h3>Strava integration</h3>
<p>
    Spur uses Strava as identity provider. Authenticated users are stored with basic information in
    Spur's database. All <em>public</em> activities uploaded to Strava by authenticated users are
    automatically synced to Spur where parts of the activity details are stored in Spur's database.
    We only store enough data to be able to calculate a score for a given challenge.
